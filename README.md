# ML-Project

## This tool will help you to build a machine learning model for your data.
#### Exploration
In data exploration import data from repository and visualize description of each feature in the data Frame (Missing values rate, descriptive statistique ..)
    
#### AutoML
AutoML is a machine learning tool that automates the process of selecting the best model for a given dataset.
It is a combination of a model selection process and a model training process.
The model selection process is the process of selecting the best model for a given dataset.
The model training process is the process of training the best model for a given dataset.
The AutoML tool is a combination of a model selection process and a model training process.

#### SemiAutoML
SemiAutoML is a machine learning tool that semi automates the process of selecting the best model for a given dataset by a **user friendly interface**.
